  "military": "MILITARY AGENDA. There are quite a few channels which cover exclusively war in Ukraine. Previously most of them covered other military conflicts and crimes. There are  channels (\"СИЛОВИКИ\", \"СИГНАЛ\") as well as individuals calling themselves \"war correspondents\" (\"Рыбарь\", \"Сладков\"). Some contain mostly reposts, some post more unique content.",
  "oftCitedNews": "OFT-CITED NEWS CHANNELS. These channels are the biggest ones. Almost all are news providers and pretend to be unbiased, except from Kadyrov_95. This one belongs to Chechnya leader and has incredibly high number of subscribers.",
  "influencers": "INFLUENCERS. Journalists, political activists, who write on different subjects. They are supposed to post their own opinion, but they might post messages paid for by pro-government agencies too. Their structure resembles nodal points with small satellites like \"Авиадиспетчер\" and \"Темы Главное Главмедиа\". There are far less oppositional influencers than pro-government.",
  "nodalPoint": "NODAL POINTS. Channels which almost don't have unique content but which are accompanied by multiple channels serving them. Not only regular channels have a bunch of exclusive satellites, but also more prominent as \"МИД России\" (Russian Ministry of foreign affairs) and \"СОЛОВЬЁВ\" (one of the most famous and odious Russian propagandists).",
  "opposition": "OPPOSITION CHANNELS. These are opposition media and journalists whose channels' structure is different from more pro-establishment channels: they don't have a bunch of satellites and don't repost each other often. They're both metaphorically and literally on the opposite side to pro-Kremlin channels.",
  "entertainment": "ENTERTAINMENT. These channels used to be Vkontakte groups which continued to work in telegram since this social became popular. They post political jokes and memes from time to time and tend to be slightly critical to the government and the war in particular."
